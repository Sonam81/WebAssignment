	<p><b> Report Introduction:</b></p>
	
The report properly describes the project's defination, its design phase, working on group and provides a proper proof of site validations. The development of the web page includes different phase and each with equal importance. In the design phase of the webpages there are different aspects that are to be properly studied for example the proper color selection, layouts, font-color, font-size, etc. Onlly after the completion of the design phase, we can continue with the development of the project. The important part of the development of webpage is the group discussion. Group discussions are very fruitful and effective in solving problems. Since two minds are always better then one mind it is always better and effective to work in pair or in group.

<b>My Experience in term I as a Web Developer</b>

<p>When I joined Nami I had little to no experience in web development. I just knew about simple html and had no idea about CSS. Before the beginning of the course I was very curious about the learning to develop web pages. At the beginning of the course it was too difficult to understand the concept of web development. In the first week I to set up or working environment. The next week was about GitHub and learned about the basic concept of html and learned. And next 3-4 week we went deeper into HTML and CSS. Gradually in the coming week I learned how html and CSS worked together make a beautiful and interactive webpage. It was very fun and exciting experience to learn to build the webpage. </p>

<p>However, it was bit difficult at the beginning but with the continuous effort and will power I was able understand much more about web development. Its just been 12 weeks and I am still learning about HTML and CSS. In the coming term I will be learning about JavaScript which will help me make webpages effective and interactive. I believe in coming days I will be better than what I am today.</p> <br>

<b>Design:</b>
<p>The concept for the layout was inspired from the website given below.<br>
<div class="img-div"><img src="Wireframes/design.png" class="img"></div><br>
<a href=" https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/web-design-trends-2017">Click here for the link.</a><br><br>
It is listed in number 12 as Serif Fonts. The design is simple yet interactive. The background of the webpage is eye appealing and it is easier for people to read the words in such background. The picture that I have included in my project webpage all belongs to me. The background image of every html file was shot in the place called Kalinchok last year.</p>
